        <p style="border-left: 2px solid black">Utrecht is a city comfortable in its own skin.
            Despite celebrating its 900th anniversary as a
            city this year, the fourth-biggest Dutch centre
            hasn’t turned its back on its small-town ways,
            rooted in its past as a Roman outpost. Daily
            activities still revolve around the medieval
            centre, where bikes rattle on cobblestones
            and the gentle flow of ancient canals sets the
            rhythm for an unhurried pace of life.
            The city has been hard at work in the lead up
            to its birthday, and there’s much to celebrate. In
            2020, it completed the high-profile restoration
            of a major canal — a project almost two decades</p>
        <p>in the making. Last year, two sites in the wider
            Utrecht province were added to the UNESCO
            World Heritage List. And in June, the citycentre ruins of the imperial palace, which burnt
            down in the 13th century, were made accessible
            to the public for the first time in decades.
            But it’s not all about the past. One of the
            country’s major university cities, Utrecht
            buzzes with a youthful spirit thanks to its
            healthy student population. And while a visit
            here is likely to start at a cultural landmark, it
            could end with an art-themed treasure hunt or
            jazz show in a futuristic concert hall.</p>

        <h2 class="underoverskrift" >Morning</h2>
         <p style="font-family:'Lato', sans-serif; line-height: 25px;">
            Be up before the city wakes to have
            the Oudegracht to yourself. The
            oldest of Utrecht’s two inner-city
            canals is its main social artery, but in
            the morning you can cycle along the
            waterside streets uninterrupted,
            admiring the gabled houses and
            pausing to fuel up at retro coffee
            shop Cafca. Afterwards, peruse
            some of the Saturday markets.
            The country’s largest and oldest
            gathering of fabric vendors,
            Lapjesmarkt has been a weekly
            fixture for over 400 years. Only a
            few streets away, you’ll find more
            colour at the Flower Market on
            Janskerkhof Square. Stop for lunch
            at nearby Ruby Rose, a restaurant
            set in a former flower shop, or try
            Streetfood Club, next door, which
            serves bites from around the world. </p>
        <h2 class="underoverskrift" >Afternoon</h2>
         <p style="font-family:'Lato', sans-serif; line-height: 25px;">
            Walk off lunch on your way to
            Domplein, a city square at the
            heart of the city’s medieval centre.
            To find it, look up and head for the
            Domtoren: at 368ft, the country’s
            highest church tower has served
            as an urban compass for almost
            700 years. Make your way up its
            495 steps for sprawling views all
            the way to Amsterdam, if the sky is
            clear. Then, descend underground
            for DOMunder, an immersive
            archaeological site that takes you
            through Domplein’s tumultuous
            2,000-year history. The other
            must-see in this square is gothic St
            Martin’s Cathedral, which used to
            be joined to the Domtoren until a
            storm destroyed its nave in 1674
            — don’t leave without taking a stroll
            around its 15th-century courtyard.</p>
        <h2 class="underoverskrift" >Evening</h2>
         <p style="font-family:'Lato', sans-serif; line-height: 25px;">
            While it’s only a 15-minute bike
            ride from the centre, getting to
            Stadsjochies feels like an escape to
            the countryside. When this urban
            farm opened a restaurant in 2021, it
            designed a menu where the cress,
            edible flowers and herbs grown on
            site take centre stage. Arrive for
            6pm for the full evening experience:
            a tour of the grounds, from the
            permafrost plot to the vertical
            garden, followed by a multi-course
            dinner in the greenhouse. If you’re
            not ready to call it a night, head
            back to the city centre to catch a
            performance at TivoliVredenburg.
            Built around the 1970s Symphony
            Hall, this huge arts venue has five
            halls, each designed for a different
            music genre, and looks striking
            when lit up after dark.  </p>

        <p class="sidebarSkrift" style="font-family:'Lato', sans-serif; line-height: 25px;"> The imperial palace, where
            Utrecht was formally
            granted city status, burnt
            down in 1253. To mark the
            900th anniversary of the
            city’s founding, a new
            archaeological site lets
            visitors explore its ruins for
            the first time in decades.
            After the tour — right
            behind the Domplein
            — spend time ducking in and
            out of the nearby cafes and
            shops: some of the palace’s
            ancient pillars and walls are
            shared by these buildings.

                Heritage Site, the Lower
                German Limes were a
                system of fortresses and
                roads that ran through
                Utrecht for almost four
                centuries, marking
                the northern frontier
                of the Roman Empire.
                Castellum Hoge Woerd
                is a reconstruction of one
                such fort and serves as
