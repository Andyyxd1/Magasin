        <p>Utrecht is a city comfortable in its own skin.
            Despite celebrating its 900th anniversary as a
            city this year, the fourth-biggest Dutch centre
            hasn’t turned its back on its small-town ways,
            rooted in its past as a Roman outpost. Daily
            activities still revolve around the medieval
            centre, where bikes rattle on cobblestones
            and the gentle flow of ancient canals sets the
            rhythm for an unhurried pace of life.
            The city has been hard at work in the lead up
            to its birthday, and there’s much to celebrate. In
            2020, it completed the high-profile restoration
            of a major canal — a project almost two decades</p>
        <p>in the making. Last year, two sites in the wider
            Utrecht province were added to the UNESCO
            World Heritage List. And in June, the citycentre ruins of the imperial palace, which burnt
            down in the 13th century, were made accessible
            to the public for the first time in decades.
            But it’s not all about the past. One of the
            country’s major university cities, Utrecht
            buzzes with a youthful spirit thanks to its
            healthy student population. And while a visit
            here is likely to start at a cultural landmark, it
            could end with an art-themed treasure hunt or
            jazz show in a futuristic concert hall.</p>

        <p class="sidebarSkrift" style="font-family:'Lato', sans-serif; line-height: 25px;"> The imperial palace, where
            Utrecht was formally
            granted city status, burnt
            down in 1253. To mark the
            900th anniversary of the
            city’s founding, a new
            archaeological site lets
            visitors explore its ruins for
            the first time in decades.
            After the tour — right
            behind the Domplein
            — spend time ducking in and
            out of the nearby cafes and
            shops: some of the palace’s
            ancient pillars and walls are
            shared by these buildings.

            <p class="sidebarSkrift" style="font-family:'Lato', sans-serif; line-height: 25px;">A new UNESCO World
                Heritage Site, the Lower
                German Limes were a
                system of fortresses and
                roads that ran through
                Utrecht for almost four
                centuries, marking
                the northern frontier
                of the Roman Empire.
                Castellum Hoge Woerd
                is a reconstruction of one
                such fort and serves as
                a cultural centre with an
                archaeological museum,
                theatre and city farm. </p>

        <p class="sidebarSkrift" style="font-family:'Lato', sans-serif; line-height: 25px;">The history of Utrecht is
            intertwined with that of
            Christianity. Housed in a
            former convent, Museum
            Catharijneconvent traces
            this story through one
            of the country’s finest
            permanent collections of
            religious art and artefacts,
            as well as temporary
